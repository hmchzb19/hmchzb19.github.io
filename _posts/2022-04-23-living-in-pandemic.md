during the age of pandemic&lock-down, document some words I wrote, they may face a 404 error someday.

```bureaucracy 会让一切变的更加魔幻，不许人群聚集，但允许聚集起来测核算```

20220401-
```一个我理想中的防疫公共政策，取消所有限制，不许任何单位和个人以防疫为名，要求员工填写各种相关的表格。取消场所码，防疫码。人有自由流动的权力，不论检测阴性阳性，公权力和任何企业单位不许施加任何限制。今天是愚人节```

20220401-
```魔幻现实主义，提倡不出门不聚集，又要求必须出门做核酸，否则个人承担一切后果。责任层级下压，推给个人，在各种bureaucracy和chain of command下，完全放开不管其实对人民来说大概率都比管要来的更好。```

20220402-
```collateral damage, 疫情中填了无数的表格，见过太多次的请如实填，否则后果自负这样的字句。每个处于command chain上的人，在面对自己的superior的时候，拿出表格i have great control on my subordinate。但是层层add，基层的人要无数次的自证清白。到最后也许连地里的黄瓜都要被拉去做核酸。越是因为疫情被撤职，下一任上来越会疯狂的control.```

```Freedom is becoming a privilege, not a right, maybe it is written in constitution. but nowadays seems it can be revoked anytime.​```

```autonomy, the patient's best interest, and the stat's interest to preserve life. 
我这一段完全是从Boston Legal上抄的，现在的防疫也许是想要在第三点上做到了极致。但是第一点autonomy , 第二点 the patient's best interest 呢？ ​​​may be I missed something, the best interest of people whose life are turned upside down by this 防疫. how about their best interest?```

```黑镜第三季第一集，everything depends on your score. need a 4.2 to get a reserved seat on a plane, when your score is low, everyone will just in a hurry to left you. and now we have健康码，绿码ok，你可以出行。黄码带星，ok，不能出行。你还必须去转码。甚至你的房东会嫌弃你，想要赶你走。want to make sure safety，需要在app上提前报备。the institution is insane and technology aid and abet in this crime to human right```

```I fell the wagon circling, for authorities, every individual's tragedy is only collateral damage which they are neglect to address.  
Come writers and critics
Who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon
For the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
For the loser now
Will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin'

Come senators, congressmen
Please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway
Don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
The battle outside ragin'
Will soon shake your windows
And rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin'```

```while Americans are not worried about Omicron but inflation, I am not worried about Omicron but Lock down. ​​​```

```我说香港的下限却变成了我们追赶不到的上限。gov只能发executive order, law需要NPC，gov的权力在防疫期间arrogant swelling.```

20220418-
```the executive power is swelling, over-stretching,  de facto lock-down is happening everywhere ,  basically it put people in quarantine , caged in house.  bureaucracy only make it even worse.  when strategic choice is based on stats, the tragedies are buried under the numbers.　but to fight this, 1 must put a limit on gov power. 2. put stats in a less important position 　however democracy will not achieved in a single night, it takes a much longer time.```

```April is warm, cozy, the breeze is soft, the video is mild and neutral,not based on hearsay but solid objective, search it i get a 404, it seems there is no tolerance for such a short mild documentary. ​​​```
